This will help to manipulate pdf files....very easily .
It mainly works with PDFs .
It manipulate different PDF files and make them easily accessible.
It mainly do 3 types of works:-
a)As now a days its very difficult to read pdf files and boring for students..also it affects there eyes a lot.So it will read the particular page of a PDF file for them in just few minutes.
b)As class notes are provided after every class and a class of a particular subject come after a week , in PDF form and it is very cumbersome and confusing job to collect every PDF .So it can combine all PDFs in just 1 single PDF which can be accessed later...with all notes of a particular subject.
c)Now a days even books are provided by schools/college and every material and again its very difficult to read all pages (for eg:a book of classical mechanics has 1043 pages) .By this program u can select only the important pages of the book and make a separate PDF file of all the useful pages and access it when neccessary.
Also it is very easy to use and can be used by a person who don't know coding as it is completly speech based program ...it tells u every time what you have to do in which step...so use it very easily
